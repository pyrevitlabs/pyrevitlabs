# pyRevit Release 5.3.1 👏

This is a huge one. A great release with very sweet improvements! (Especially with the bug I missed about panelbutton [@Wurschdhaud](https://github.com/Wurschdhaud) ;) , that explains the 5.3.**1**)

Maybe AI has something to do with it! Lots of new tools, lots of improvements, lots of fixes, lots of help.

I may forget quite a few people, some easily identified, others, more discrete: 🙏 🚀 🌟
