# ðŸŽ‰ Software Supporter from devloAI tool and ADN (Autodesk Dev Network) and BIG donation

## devloAI
After a few weeks of trial [DevloAI](https://devlo.ai), It provided with some pretty good analysis and pointers on solving Issues on github and helping commenting PR. It still is a tech based on LLMs so you have to take everything with a pinch of salt. But so far, pretty good.

I reach out to the devloAI team about OSS support program and got a friendly answer from the devloAI team and Yawar. 
They do not have a program yet, but we have free access for now!

## Autodesk ADN

[Andrew Milner](https://github.com/milnera92) reached out a couple of months ago. User of pyRevit AND works inside the factory on the ADN side.
He porposed to facilitate access to ADN membership for pyRevit. 
                                     
Long story short, we recieved free membership to ADN and dev licence to Revit!

All that is pretty cool, and we are thankful for the support!


## BIG Donation

[BIG Architecture Firm](https://big.dk/) made a rather BIG donation of 1200 USD.
(I cannot tell who at BIG facilitated the donation, but thank you)
This will help cover hosting and certificate cost.
