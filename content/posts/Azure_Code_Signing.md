# 🎉 New Code Signing Certificate and implementation

The Certificate for code signing expired end of last year, AND, new rules from certification authorities, it was time for a new headache.
As of today, all WIP installers are signed through Azure Trusted Signing. A lot of sweat to get there (many evening of reading, asking around, a looong evening of implementation going through https://melatonin.dev/blog/code-signing-on-windows-with-azure-trusted-signing/ and finally a morning of debugging) but a fairly cheap and reliable solution is in place now.

The Certificate if under my name, Jean-Marc Couffin. I could not create an org / enterprise certificate are pyrevitlabs is not an org or a business, but just a small bunch of enthusiasts.

It seems to work great. Feel free to report any issue on the repo.
