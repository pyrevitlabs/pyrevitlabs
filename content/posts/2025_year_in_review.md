# pyRevit - 2025 Year in Review

**2025 was a year of consolidation, technical progress, and growing contributor momentum for pyRevit.**  
Across releases, pull requests, and forum discussions, the project continued to mature while welcoming new contributors and laying the groundwork for the next major platform transition.

## 🚀 Product Progress & New Features

2025 delivered a steady stream of improvements across the **pyRevit 5.x series** — not just compatibility work, but real workflow upgrades and tooling polish.

Notable highlights from the year include:
- Continued **stability and compatibility improvements for Revit 2025**
- Numerous **tool refinements and bug fixes** driven by production feedback
- Quality-of-life improvements around printing, exporting, progress reporting, and crash prevention
- Improvements to **CLI workflows**, installer behavior, and runtime handling
- Ongoing cleanup and modernization of internal structure to support future platform changes

Community-contributed features and fixes played a major role, including:
- New and enhanced tools such as **Measure 3D improvements**, **Sectionbox Navigator**, **Relink Textures**, and other usability-focused updates
- Community extensions like **pyrevit-mcp** by **@JotaDeRodriguez** and the **Quickly Toolbar** extension by **@tay0thman**
- Important fixes and maintenance work credited to contributors such as **@thumDer**
- A key **panelbutton bug fix** credited to **@Wurschdhaud**, which helped set the quality bar for the 5.3.1 release

Rather than one single headline feature, 2025 was defined by **cumulative quality gains** that made pyRevit more robust, predictable, and maintainable.
