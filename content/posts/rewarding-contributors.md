# Rewarding main contributors

Hello pyReviters, 

I mentioned, a month back or so, I was willing to [reward contribution to the repo and community](https://discourse.pyrevitlabs.io/t/rfc-poll-issue-backlog-challenge/9358) with the money collected from supporters on Open Collective https://opencollective.com/pyrevitlabs/expenses.

I thought first about making a bounty program, but rapidly felt this would be overwhelming. I don’t have that much time to put into it, and the management time would have been disproportionate. So like every good autocrat and coder, I made a script to harvest relevant data from the github repo (cursor and a few minutes later - see at the end of this post if you are curious)

So here they are the proud contributors, reviewers, actors, action figures of the past months in no particular order:
- @sanzoghenzo for his code reviews, answers on the forum, and his kind nudges when I derail
- @pyrevti / aka Wurschdhaud on gh, for many smart improvements and cool PRs
- @tayOthman for its support in the past year: Comments, PR, Answers, Fixing issues, you name it
- @Mohamed.Asli for his fresh and intense involvement with cool new tools
- @romangolev for his ongoing PR to refactor the Loader into C# which will be a great speed improvement _ this is both a reward and a nudge, and if someone wants to help him out... https://github.com/pyrevitlabs/pyRevit/pull/2647

All of them received a 250 € or $ gift card from whatever eshop they liked or used (or the ones I could get to process my payment methods from Czech Rep. :grimacing: )

**Notes:**
_ I know € or $ are not equal _  don't bother, I told you I am the autocrat
_ I also know that not all contributions are equal in terms of the value, time invested, ... but to me, getting to spend your own time to improve pyRevit for an extended period is something valuable in itself, and not everyone comes with the same background, so, All volunteers are welcome if they help sustain pyRevit _ you can add socialist/communist to autocrat :winking_face_with_tongue: 
_ If you want to take a look at how the money is being used, this is all there https://opencollective.com/pyrevitlabs/expenses

Looking at the contributions so far, it looks like I could reward 10 contributors this year.
